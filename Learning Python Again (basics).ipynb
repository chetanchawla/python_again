    "Python is a powerful programming language having efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. It has a simple syntax and dynamic typing. Python is interpreted (not compiled). It is used for scripting and rapid application development. It can be categorized as a very-high-level language having high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python is interpreted, the execution of code is line by line. Which means, each statement in Python is converted to machine language one by one while running them. This is in comparison to compiled languages in which, the whole code is analysed, parsed and converted into executable machine code before running the program. Compilers take more time analysing and converting the code, however as it is converted before-hand, the execution is faster. But in interpreted languages, we can do away with the write/compile/test/re-compile cycle, which is extremely slow while you are developing something."
